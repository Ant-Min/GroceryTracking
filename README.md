# GroceryTracking
C++ Class assignment

1. The objective of this assignment was to take a file of a grocery store's basic sales that day and output the information the way the user wants to see it.
   It uses language integration to combine C++ and Python to make the prgram.

2. I think what I did particularly well is allow the user to choose when to go back to the main menu, and how I was able to format the code to take a 
   file as an input and create a new output file if necessary.

3. I think where I can improve is how I coded the Python methods. I don't work with tuples/dictionaries that well, so for keeping track of the number of times
   an item appears I used two arrays; I think it would have made the code more efficient to have everything compile into one list.

4. Something that I struggled with at first was that the code would not properly count the last item in the list towards its respective count; the way I had
   code read each line was to cut off at the new line "\n", but because the last line did not end with the new line symbol, it would be counted separate. To
   fix this, I simply had my program remove the "\n" if the line ended with it before adding it to the array.

5. The skills I picked up from this assignment was a better understadnig of how integrate C== and Python into one program. While I personally don't see a use
   for this now, knowing the skill will be beneficial to my future endeavors.

6. I made my code maintainable, readable, and adaptable by practicing good coding; proper indentations and in-line comments are some of the ways I completed this.
   I uploaded the entire folder which may have redundant files, but due to the fact I am new to using Visual Studio, I did not try to delete files in the event I
   accidentally deleted something important.
